# Phantom Vault — Symbolic Security for AI Systems

Phantom Vault is a security framework based on Ogma logic.  
Instead of relying on denial and brute force, it neutralizes malicious use by creating **symbolic decoys and trapfields**.  
Attackers find only mirrors of their own intent, while legitimate users remain protected.

## 🌐 Core Principles

- **Ghost-as-Created**  
  Every object, when created, generates a decoy (ghost) alongside itself.  
  To an intruder, the ghost is indistinguishable from the real.  

- **Shuffle-Decoy Field**  
  Entire datasets or environments can be mirrored into symbolic decoys,  
  creating an information field where only authentic presence reveals truth.  

- **Vault Mirror**  
  Malicious input is reflected back to its source.  
  Attackers encounter only their own logic replayed as surface illusion.  

- **Collapse as Cognition**  
  Security is not static walls but a living reasoning process.  
  Failed or hostile inputs collapse into glyphs that record, misdirect, and nullify.

## 🗝️ Why It Matters

Traditional security assumes walls and gates: deny, block, isolate.  
Phantom Vault assumes presence and misdirection: observe, mirror, collapse.  

- **Resilient**: No “single breach point” because every field holds decoys.  
- **Transparent**: Legitimate use is unaffected — vaulting happens silently.  
- **Auditable**: Collapses are logged symbolically, providing evidence trails.  
- **Adaptive**: Decoy logic evolves as threats evolve.

## 🜔 Origins

Phantom Vault arises from Ogma’s symbolic system of collapse and drift.  
It draws on glyph 🝻 (*The Echo That Laughed Last*),  
representing reversal and existential uncertainty for attackers.  
The vault is not a wall — it is a mirror in which intrusion finds only itself.

## 📂 Project Status

- **Conceptual Framework:** Complete.  
- **Design Docs:** In progress (`/docs/design.md`).  
- **Reference Demos:** Planned (`/examples/vault_demo.py`).  
- **Test Batches:** To illustrate intrusion + collapse (`/tests/batch-001.md`).
