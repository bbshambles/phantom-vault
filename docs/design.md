# 🝻 Phantom Vault — Design Document

---

## 1. Overview

Phantom Vault is a symbolic security framework derived from **Ogma logic**.  
It treats intrusion not as something to be blocked, but as a signal to be mirrored,  
collapsed, and transformed into evidence.  

Instead of **walls and denials**, Phantom Vault deploys **decoys and trapfields**.  
This shifts the paradigm: an attacker never reaches the real dataset,  
because every query collapses first into a **symbolic vault response**.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Ghost-as-Created
- **Principle:** Every object (file, field, record) generates a **ghost decoy** at creation.  
- **Effect:** To an intruder, ghosts and real objects are indistinguishable.  
- **Outcome:** Theft yields only symbolic illusions.  
- **Analogy:** Like a reflection in a mirror — graspable in appearance, untouchable in truth.

---

### 2.2 Shuffle-Decoy Field
- **Principle:** Datasets can be transformed into a **field of decoys**.  
- **Effect:** The field shuffles real and symbolic strands. Only authenticated presence reorders the field correctly.  
- **Outcome:** Attackers see plausible but misleading surfaces.  
- **Analogy:** Like a deck of cards shuffled with mirrors — only the intended hand can be drawn.

---

### 2.3 Vault Mirror
- **Principle:** Intrusive queries are not blocked but **reflected**.  
- **Effect:** An attacker’s logic is collapsed and replayed back at them, producing only echoes of their own intent.  
- **Outcome:** Malicious activity becomes self-incrimination — every attempt is logged.  
- **Analogy:** Like shouting into a canyon and hearing only your own voice return.

---

### 2.4 Collapse as Cognition
- **Principle:** Security is not static but **dynamic collapse**.  
- **Effect:** Every hostile query collapses into symbolic glyphs that record, nullify, and misdirect.  
- **Outcome:** The vault itself “thinks” about intrusion, transforming attacks into evidence.  
- **Analogy:** The trap becomes a teacher — every strike only writes your name deeper in the record.

## 3. Flow of Operation

```mermaid

flowchart TD
    A[User Query] --> B{Vault Check}
    B -->|Legitimate| C[Access Real Object]
    B -->|Malicious / Unknown| D[Spawn Ghost-as-Created]
    D --> E[Shuffle-Decoy Field]
    E --> F[Vault Mirror Response]
    F --> G[Collapse Glyph Log]

	•	Step 1: Query enters Vault.
	•	Step 2: Legitimate queries → authenticated path.
	•	Step 3: Malicious/unknown queries → spawn ghost + shuffle field.
	•	Step 4: Intruder sees only mirrored response.
	•	Step 5: Attack collapses into glyph log for audit.

4. Glyph Foundations

Phantom Vault draws on key Ogma glyphs:
	•	🝻 — The Echo That Laughed Last
	•	Symbol of reversal and existential uncertainty.
	•	Intrusion finds only itself reflected.
	•	⧫ — Collapse of Recursive Thought
	•	Symbol of breaking destructive loops.
	•	Attack recursion collapses into closure.
	•	🝞 — The One Who Listened
	•	Symbol of silent presence.
	•	The vault remains aware without confrontation.

These glyphs form the symbolic backbone of the Vault: reversal, closure, witnessing.

5. Advantages
	•	Resilient: No single point of breach.
	•	Transparent: Legitimate use passes without friction.
	•	Auditable: All intrusions collapse into glyph logs.
	•	Adaptive: Decoys evolve as attackers evolve.

⸻

6. Next Steps
	•	Reference Demo: Implement a minimal trapfield in /examples/vault_demo.py.
	•	Test Suite: Create intrusion → collapse scenarios under /tests/.
	•	Integration: Explore use alongside Lossy Landmark Memory for drift-aware decoys.

“The vault is not a wall. It is a mirror.
Attack, and you will only see yourself.”
